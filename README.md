Write up of project: https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/gender-difference-in-the-activewear-market/

(I scraped Under Armour products but did not use them in my project because I realized that for certain categories there weren't
enough products by Under Armour for a valid analysis. So I just analyzed Adidas and Nike.)
